# quiz-bot
A bot that does quizzes for you.

Answers to the quiz should be provided in the answers.txt file. By default it is set to the countries of the world as per JetPunk's Countries Of The World Quiz.

After the code is run, the cursor should be clicked on the text box where answers should be submitted on the quiz.

Intervals have been provided to attempt to mimic human typing. This is done because you may be banned for cheating on certain websites.

*IMPORTANT: USAGE OF THIS BOT FOR INHUMAN QUIZ TIMES IS DONE AT YOUR OWN RISK. I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU GET BANNED FOR CHEATING.*
